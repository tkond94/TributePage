    <h2>Early Years</h2>
    <p>Nelson Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in the village of <br>
       Mvezo, Transkei, South Africa, rose to prominence as a symbol<br> 
       of resistance against apartheid, the institutionalized racial<br> 
       segregation and discrimination enforced by the South African<br> 
       government. After studying law at the University of Fort Hare<br> 
       and the University of Witwatersrand, Mandela became involved<br> 
       in anti-colonial politics, joining the African National Congress<br> 
       (ANC) in 1943.</p>

        <div id="activism">
    <h2>Activism</h2>
    <p>Mandela's activism against apartheid intensified in the 1950s,<br> 
       leading to his involvement in organizing peaceful protests, strikes,<br>
       and acts of civil disobedience. However, the government's crackdown <br>
       on dissent led to Mandela's arrest and subsequent trial in the infamous<br>
        Rivonia Trial in 1964. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage <br>
        and conspiracy to overthrow the government.</p>

   <h2>Imprisonment</h2>
     <p>During his 27 years of incarceration, Mandela became a global symbol of <br>
        resistance to apartheid. Despite harsh conditions and isolation on Robben <br>
        Island and later in Pollsmoor Prison, he remained steadfast in his commitment<br>
        to justice and equality. Mandela's imprisonment garnered international attention,<br>
        leading to widespread calls for his release and increased pressure on the <br>
        apartheid regime.</p>

        <div id="endingA">
    <h2>Ending apartheid</h2>
    <p>In 1990, after years of international pressure and internal reforms, the South <br>
       African government finally released Mandela from prison. He emerged as a unifying<br>
       figure, advocating for reconciliation and negotiation to end apartheid peacefully.<br>
       Mandela played a pivotal role in the negotiations that led to the dismantling of <br>
       apartheid and the establishment of multiracial democratic elections in South Africa.</p>

    <h2>First Black President</h2>
    <p>In 1994, Nelson Mandela made history by becoming South Africa's first black president <br>
       in the country's first fully representative democratic election. As president, Mandela<br>
       worked tirelessly to heal the wounds of apartheid, promote national unity, and address<br>
       the socioeconomic disparities plaguing South Africa. He implemented policies aimed at <br>
       reconciliation, nation-building, and social justice, earning him widespread respect both<br>
       domestically and internationally.

    <h2>Icon</h2>
    <p>After serving one term as president, Mandela retired from politics but remained active in<br>
       humanitarian work, focusing on issues such as HIV/AIDS awareness, education, and peace-building<br>
       efforts across the African continent. He continued to inspire millions as a global statesman <br>
       and an icon of courage, compassion, and resilience until his passing on December 5, 2013. <br>
       Mandela's legacy as a champion of human rights and dignity endures, serving as a beacon of hope<br>
       for future generations striving for equality and justice worldwide.</p>
